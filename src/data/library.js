From late summer to fall, spikes of brilliant red, trumpet-shaped flowers put on a profuse show. Resembling fuchsias, they produce nectar, supplying hummingbirds with food for the start of their southward migration. Once pollinated, the flowers produce pods that contain the seeds. These pods split laterally along the sides, releasing the seeds which have a feathery appendage for wind dispersal. Native to the southwestern states in the US, it is the perfect plant for rock and gravel gardens, raised beds, or dry-stone walls, where it will offer an abundance of the most brilliant scarlet flowers for weeks. Its low-growing habit makes it suitable as a groundcover or for the front of the sunny border too.",

The leaves are covered with a sticky resin, giving them a varnished appearance. This is a protection against water loss, which enables the plant to be incredibly drought tolerant. Small, inconspicuous chartreuse flowers, without true petals, appear in terminal clusters in spring. They are followed in summer and fall by showy, ornamental, papery seed capsules adorned with 3-4 rounded wings. Emerging green, they turn yellow-green, then brilliant pink and red. A popular choice in warm, arid regions of the U.S., Florida Hopbush is extraordinarily versatile. It is a handsome shrub worthy of inclusion in the landscape or used as a screen, informal hedge, or espalier. Tolerant to drought and coastal conditions, Florida Hopbush attracts birds into the garden and is perfect for the waterwise garden.",

Borne on a thick stem which can reach 4 ft. (120 cm), the rosette is composed of flexible leaves which gracefully arch back, resembling an open flower. This Agave derives its common name from the impressive arching flower stalk which emerges from the rosette in summer. Reaching up to 5-10 ft. in height (150-300 cm), it reflexes back towards the ground before arching up again like a fox tail. It bears greenish-yellow flowers which give way to seed pods and many new plantlets. This Agave plant makes a dramatic focal point or accent and can be used in decorative pots.",

        "Adding a bright note year-round, Asparagus densiflorus âMyersiiâ (Asparagus Fern)) is a very ornamental, tuberous, evergreen perennial with erect to arching stems densely clothed with delicate, plume-like foliage. Resembling foxtails, The deep green foliage looks great in floral arrangements. Small, inconspicuous, fragrant, white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. They are followed by few red berries which ripen by fall. Native to eastern Africa and South Africa, Asparagus densiflorus species has been widely introduced globally as an ornamental. It is considered invasive in Australia and parts of the United States including Florida, Hawaii, and southern California. The species can form dense spiny mats, suppressing other ground flora and depleting the soil of nutrients and moisture. Birds eat the berries and help spread the seed to new locations where the seed will often readily sprout. Myersii is more compact than the species and produces fewer berries. It is therefore much less of an invasive threat. This is one of the most popular cultivars.",

      description:
        "Native to the western U. S., Baccharis pilularis (Coyote Bush) is an evergreen shrub of very variable habit. It grows in a prostrate and mat-forming form on dunes and coastal areas with onshore winds and salt spray and in an upright and rounded form at higher elevations inland. Its dark brown stems are clad with oval to rounded, shiny bright green leaves. Coyote Bush is dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants. From mid-summer to fall, a profusion of white female flowers and yellow male flowers occur in small, dense, terminal clusters. Coyote Bush is an extremely important plant for pollinators (bees, wasps, butterflies), due to its abundant production of pollen and nectar and its late bloom period. Coyote Bush is also great wildlife habitat providing cover for rabbits and other small mammals. The flowers are followed on female plants by copious amounts of silvery-white, plume-like seeds resembling paintbrushes. To avoid seed production, you may want to choose a male plant â although you will miss the showy white fruits. Attractive at a time when few other small trees and shrubs are flowering, Coyote Bush is tolerant of heat, drought, wind, and poor or dry soils. Noted for its deer resistance and bright green foliage throughout the year, Coyote Bush is a useful low-maintenance groundcover for sunny banks. Fire-retardant, it is also used for restoration and erosion control projects. The upright form of Coyote Bush is a reliable choice for hedgerows as it is easy to establish from transplants and to manage by pruning.",

        "Eschscholzia caespitosa (Tufted Poppy) is a showy annual forming a low mound of feathery bluish-green leaves. From spring to early summer, fragrant, 4-petalled, orange to yellow flowers to 2 in. across (5 cm) are borne atop thin, erect stems. After the petals drop off, a capsule will form and turn from green to tan. The capsule will eventually split and explosively releases its seeds in the landscape. Native to western North America from Oregon to Baja California, Tufted Poppy occurs naturally in coastal sage scrub, sandy meadows, and stream banks. It is quite similar in appearance to its cousin, the California Poppy (Eschscholzia californica). Quick to bloom and ridiculously easy to grow, it looks spectacular planted in drifts, adding a wave of warm color in the landscape. It is a fine choice for rock gardens, coastal gardens, or wildflower meadows.",

It is prized for its aromatic, narrowly ovate, leathery leaves, up to 4 in. long (10 cm). Beautiful through the seasons, they are useful in cooking and indispensable in French and other Mediterranean cookery. Small pale greenish-yellow flowers borne in dense clusters bloom in spring. They are followed by glossy purple-black berries on female plants. Long-lived, Bay Laurel is wonderful for topiary and hedges, essential in the herb garden and serves as a great container plant.",

Growing no more than 1-3 in. tall (2-7 cm), its tiny and narrow, gray-green leaves curl slightly, exposing the white underside of the leaves and conferring a variegated look. Small yellow daisy flowers appear nestled amongst the foliage in summer.
